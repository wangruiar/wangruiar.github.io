<h3 id="why-search">Why Search</h3>

<p>很多人工智能的问题都可以用搜索来求解（例如博弈）</p>

<h3 id="形式化方法">形式化方法</h3>

<p>Once the problem has been formulated as a state space search, various algorithms can be utilized to solve the problem.</p>

<p>A solution to the problem will be a sequence of actions/moves that can transform your current state into state where your desired condition holds.</p>

<p>将一个问题形式化为搜索问题的组分如下：</p>

<ul>
  <li>搜索空间</li>
  <li>动作：状态间的转移</li>
  <li>初始状态</li>
  <li>目标状态</li>
  <li>形式化一些启发方法，使得更快到达目标状态</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>a specified initial state (a specific world state or a set of world states representing the agent’s knowledge, etc.)</li>
  <li>指定的初始状态(特定的世界状态或代表Agent知识的一组世界状态等)</li>
  <li>a successor function S(x) = {set of states that can be reached from state x via a single action}.</li>
  <li>后继函数S(X)={可通过单个动作从状态x到达的状态集}。</li>

  <li>目标测试可应用于状态的函数，如果状态满足目标条件，则返回TRUE。</li>
  <li>A step cost function C(x,a,y) which determines the cost of moving from state x to state y using action a. ($C(x,a,y) = \infty$ if a does not yield y from x)</li>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<ul>
  <li>a sequence of states leading from the initial state to a state satisfying the goal test.</li>
  <li>从初始状态到满足目标测试的状态序列。</li>
  <li>The set of successors of a state x might arise from different actions, e.g.,</li>
  <li>状态x的后继者集合可能产生于不同的动作，例如，
    <ul>
      <li>x → a → y</li>
      <li>x → b → z</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Successor function S(x) yields a set of states that can be reached from x via a (any) single action.</li>
  <li>后继函数S(X)产生可以通过(任何)单个动作从x到达的一组状态。
    <ul>
      <li>Rather than just return a set of states, we might annotate these states by the action used to obtain them:</li>
      <li>不只是返回一组状态，我们可以通过用于获取这些状态的操作来注释这些状态：
        <ul>
          <li>S(x) = {&lt;y,a&gt;, &lt;z,b&gt;}  y via action a, z via action b.</li>
          <li>S(x) = {&lt;y,a&gt;, &lt;y,b&gt;} y via action a, also y via alternative action b.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h5 id="time-complexity">Time complexity</h5>

<h4 id="depth-limited-search深度受限搜索">Depth-limited search（深度受限搜索）</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Breadth-ﬁrst has problems with space complexity</li>
  <li>Depth-ﬁrst can run down a very long or inﬁnite path</li>
  <li>Perform depth ﬁrst search but only to a pre-speciﬁed depth limit L</li>

<ul>
  <li>Solve the problems of depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst by extending depth limited search</li>
  <li>Starting at depth limit L = 0, we iteratively increase the depth limit, performing a depth limited search for each depth limit</li>
  <li>Stop if a solution is found, or if the depth limited search failed without cutting oﬀ any nodes because of the depth limit</li>
  <li>If no nodes were cut oﬀ, the search examined all paths in the state space and found no solution, hence no solution exists.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="completeness-and-optimality-2">Completeness and optimality</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Completeness: Yes</li>
  <li>Optimality: Yes if costs are uniform</li>
  <li>If costs are not uniform, we can use a cost bound instead
    <ul>
      <li>Only expand paths of cost less than the cost bound.</li>
      <li>Keep track of the minimum cost unexpanded path in each depth ﬁrst iteration, increase the cost bound to this on the next iteration.</li>
      <li>This can be very expensive. Need as many iterations of the search as there are distinct path costs.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="bidirectional-search">Bidirectional search</h4>

  <li>Optimality: if edges have uniform costs Time and space complexity: $O(b^{d/2})$</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="path-checking">Path checking</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Recall paths are stored on the frontier</li>
  <li>If $&lt;n_1,\ldots,n_{k}&gt;$ is a path to node $n_k$, and we expand $n_k$ to obtain child $c$, we have $&lt;n_1,\ldots,n_{k},c&gt;$ as the path to $c$</li>
  <li>Path checking ensures that the state $c$ is not equal to the state reached by any ancestor of $c$ along this path</li>
  <li>That is, paths are checked in isolation!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cycle-checking--multiple-path-checking">Cycle checking / multiple path checking</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Keep track of all states previously expanded during the search</li>
  <li>When we expand nk to obtain child c, ensure that c is not equal to any previously expanded state</li>
  <li>Why can’t we utilize this technique with depth-ﬁrst search?</li>
  <li>High space complexity, <strong>only useful with breadth ﬁrst search</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="issue-with-optimality">Issue with optimality</h5>

<ul>
  <li>With uniform-cost search, we still ﬁnd an optimal solution</li>
  <li>The ﬁrst time uniform-cost expands a state it has found the minimal cost path to it.</li>
  <li>This means that the nodes rejected by cycle checking can’t have better paths.</li>
  <li>We will see later that we don’t always have this property when we do heuristic search.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="path--cycle-checking">Path / cycle checking</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Path checking: when we expand n to obtain child c, ensures that the state c is not equal to the state reached by any ancestor of c along this path</li>
  <li>Cycle checking: keep track of all states previously expanded during the search; when we expand n to obtain child c, ensure that c is not equal to any previously expanded state</li>
  <li>For uniform-cost search, cycle checking preserves optimality</li>
</ul>
